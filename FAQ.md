## CNF Test Suite Frequently Asked Questions

### General

<details> <summary>What is the CNF Test Suite?</summary>
<p>

### Technical and Usage

<details> <summary>Can I run the CNF Test Suite without a Kubernetes cluster?</summary>
<p>

- In simple terms, no. You need some type of Kubernetes (K8s) cluster whether it's bare metal, kind, Docker and so on to run the CNF Test Suite against your CNF.

</p>
</details>

<details> <summary>Does the CNF Test Suite have any pre-requisites or other requirements to run?</summary>
<p>

- Yes. There are a few requirements for the CNF Test Suite. You can read about the requirements in the [INSTALL Guide](INSTALL.md#prerequisites).

</p>
</details>

<details> <summary>How are points assigned for tests?</summary>
<p>

- Points are different for each test and workload but in general terms, pass defaults to 5 and fail is a -1. See [points.yml](https://github.com/cncf/cnf-testsuite/blob/main/embedded_files/points.yml) for more details on the different points for default scoring.

</p>
</details>

<details> <summary>Does the CNF Test Suite support or run on other architectures besides amd64?</summary>
<p>

- Not currently at this time.

</p>
</details>

<details> <summary>Can I run the CNF Test Suite on clusters currently in use?</summary>
<p>

- Yes but it's not recommended. There is a destructive option that will test your nodes with reboots and recovery. We recommend that tests are run in an environment that is not currently used by others, typically in a test or dev environment setting.

</p>
</details>

<details> <summary>I ran several tests and missed the output of the results, are these lost or can I view past test results?</summary>
<p>

- All test results are stored in the results/ directory of where you installed the CNF Test Suite in yaml format.

</p>
</details>

<details> <summary>Why is the CNF Test Suite written in Crystal and not in other languages like Go?</summary>
<p>

- The short answer is [Crystal](https://crystal-lang.org) fit the criteria we looked at in a language at the time which needed to run external programs/test suites and internal tests - [Taylor Carpenter](https://app.slack.com/client/T08PSQ7BQ/G019HM3K54H/user_profile/U7HCKCW90) via https://slack.cncf.io/
- Usability for Humans - Crystal, puts readablility for humans as a priority, which is why its syntax heavily inspired by Ruby.
- Type checking system to help humans catch their errors earlier
- Compiled language for portability, reduced size, and performance
- Metaprogramming through Crystal's powerful macro system
- Concurrency throughy green threads, called fiberes, which communicate over channels like Go lang and Clojure
- Dependency management for libraries and applications via the [crystal manager Shards](https://github.com/crystal-lang/shards)

### Troubleshooting

<details> <summary>Running cnf-testsuite says "No found config" or similiar type errors?</summary>
<p>

- This may indicate that you are not pointing to a valid cnf-testsuite.yml config file for your CNF. You may want to read or review the [INSTALL](INSTALL.md) instructions or the [USAGE Documentation](USAGE.md).
