  # All docker images can have one, two, three, or more segments. The docker images that have 
  # multiple segments are separated by a slash.
  #
  # ** Multiple segments **
  # (Fully qualified) registry name with optional port /Org/image combination
  # Multiple segment examples: e.g. docker.io/coredns/coredns
  # mydockerregistry.io:8080/coredns/coredns, mydockerregistry.io:8080/coredns/coredns:latest,	
  # mydockerregistry.io:8080/privatecordnsorg/coredns/coredns:latest
  #
  # Two segment examples: coredns/coredns,
  # 	docker.io/busybox,
  # 	myhostname:5000/myimagename:mytag
  #
  #	1) If the first segment has a period . in it, then the segment is a 
  # fully qualified domain name.
  #
  #	2) If the first segment has colon in it : everything after the colon 
  # is a port number
  #  a) If there are three or more segments, all segments (the middle 
  # segments) from the first and before the last are org names
  #
  # 3) If the first segment is not a fully qualified domain name 
  #  a) if there are two elements, the first element is an org
  #  b) If there are three or more segments, all segments excluding 
  #  the last are org names
  #
  # ** The last segment (or one segment) **
  # Official docker image string
  # e.g. busybox
  #
  # 4.a) If the docker image is only one segment,docker.io is used for the 
  # registry, the whole segment is used image name, and if there is no 
  # tag, `latest` is used as the tag 
  #
  # 4.b) Everything in the one segment (or the last segment if there are 
  # multiple segments) is an image or image:tag combination.
