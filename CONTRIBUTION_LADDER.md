Hello! We are excited that you want to learn how to get involved with the CNF Test Suite! This contributor ladder outlines the different contributor roles within the project, along with the responsibilities and privileges that come with them. Community members generally start at the first levels of the "ladder" and advance up it as their involvement in the project grows. Our project members are happy to help you advance along the contributor ladder.

Each of the contributor roles below is organized into lists of three types of things. "Responsibilities" are things that contributor is expected to do. "Requirements" are qualifications a person needs to meet to be in that role, and "Privileges" are things contributors on that level are entitled to.

You will need to gain people's trust, demonstrate your competence and understanding, and meet the requirements of the role.

## Community Member

### How to become a contributor

To become a contributor, the maintainers of the project would like to see you:

* Comment on issues with your experiences and opinions.
* Add your comments and reviews on pull requests.
* Contribute pull requests.
* Open issues with bugs, enhancement ideas, and questions.

Contributors and maintainers will do their best to watch for community members
who make good contributors. But don’t be shy, if you feel that this is you,
please reach out to one or more of the contributors or [maintainers](MAINTAINERS.md).


## Maintainer

[Maintainers][maintainers] are members with extra capabilities:

* Be a [Code Owner](.github/CODEOWNERS) and have reviews automatically requested.
* Review pull requests.
* Merge pull requests.

Maintainers also have additional responsibilities beyond just merging code:

* Help foster a safe and welcoming environment for all project participants.
  This will include understanding and enforcing our [Code of Conduct](code-of-conduct.md).
* Organize and promote pull request reviews, e.g. prompting community members,
  contributors, and other maintainers to review.
* Triage issues, e.g. adding labels, promoting discussions, finalizing decisions.
* Help organize our development meetings, e.g. schedule, organize and
  execute agenda.

Maintainers must agree to and follow the [Reviewing Guide](REVIEWING.md).


### How to become a maintainer

To become a maintainer, we would like to see you be an effective
contributor, and show that you can do some of the things maintainers do.
Maintainers will do their best to regularly discuss promoting contributors. But
don’t be shy, if you feel that this is you, please reach out to one or more of
the maintainers.

## Admin

[Admins][admins] are maintainers with extra responsibilities:


* Manage repositories
* Manage CODEOWNERS file
* Manage GitHub Actions infra (eg. runners)
* Manage teams


### How to become an admin

It isn't expected that all maintainers will need or want to move up to admin. If
you are a maintainer, and find yourself often asking an admin to do certain
tasks for you and you would like to help out with administrative tasks, please
reach out to one or more of the admins.
