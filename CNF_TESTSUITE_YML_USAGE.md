# Test Suite Configuration Usage: cnf-testsuite.yml
### What is the cnf-testsuite.yml and why is it required?:

The cnf-testsuite.yml is used by `cnf_install` in order to install the CNF to be tested onto an existing K8s cluster. 


The information in the cnf-testsuite.yml is also used for additional configuration of some tests e.g. `white_list_container_names` is used for exculding containers from the [privileged_containers](https://github.com/lfn-cnti/testsuite/blob/main/src/tasks/workload/security.cr#L138) container test.

### Overview of all cnf-testsuite.yml

The following is a basic working example cnf-testsuite.yml file that can be found in the cnf-testcatalog respository: [cnf-testcatalog/spec/fixtures/cnf-testsuite-v2-example.yml](https://github.com/lfn-cnti/testsuite/blob/main/spec/fixtures/cnf-testsuite-v2-example.yml)

```yaml=
---
config_version: "v2"
common: 
  container_names:
    - name: coredns
      rolling_update_test_tag: "1.8.0"
      rolling_downgrade_test_tag: 1.6.7
      rolling_version_change_test_tag: 1.8.0
      rollback_from_tag: 1.8.0

deployments:
  helm_charts:
    - name: coredns
      helm_repo_name: stable
      helm_repo_url: https://cncf.gitlab.io/stable
      helm_chart_name: coredns
#  helm_dirs:
#    - name: envoy
#      helm_directory: ../example-cnfs/envoy/envoy
#  manifests:
#    - name: nginx
#      manifest_directory: manifests
```

### Generator Quick Start

cnf-testsuite.yml can be dynamically generated by running `./cnf-testsuite generate_config`.
The process is interactive an should be friendly to new users.
Prereqs: You must have kubernetes cluster, curl, and helm 3.1.1 or greater on your system already.

### Updating config from older versions

New releases may change the format of cnf-testsuite.yml. To update your older configs automatically to the latest version, use the `update_config` task.

```
./cnf-testsuite update_config input_config=OLD_CONFIG_PATH output_config=NEW_CONFIG_PATH
```

### Keys and Values

#### Config version

Current config version is `"v2"`
Missing config version is presumed to be config version `"v1"`, which is not supported, but should be transformed to new version if written correctly.

#### Common Parameters

Common parameters are required for proper functioning of some tests. If these parameters are not set up, corresponding tests will be failed/skipped or would not function properly (in example - white_list_container_names).
`common: ...`

##### container_names
Array of container parameters for rolling version change tests, example:
  name: coredns
  rolling_update_test_tag: 1.8.0
  rolling_downgrade_test_tag: 1.6.7
  rolling_version_change_test_tag: 1.8.0
  rollback_from_tag: 1.8.0


##### white_list_container_names

The values of this key are the names of the 'containers' defined in the Kubernetes pod spec of pods that are allowed to be running in privileged mode. (Optional)
This value is used to allow 'particular' pods to run in privileged mode on the K8s cluster where the CNF is installed.
The reason this is needed is because the Test Suite will check, 'all' pods in the cluster, to see if they're running in privileged mode.
This is done because it's a common cloud-native practice to delegate 'privileged' networking tasks to only a single app e.g. Multus, NSM vs making the CNF privileged itself. As a consequence the whitelist can only be used to exempt 'privileged' infrastructure services running as pods e.g. NSM, Multus and cannot be used to exempt the CNF under test.

Example setting:

`white_list_container_names: [coredns]`

##### `docker_insecure_registries`

The docker client expects the image registries to be using an HTTPS API endpoint. This option is used to configure insecure registries that the docker client should be allowed to access.

This parameter is responsible for configuring Docker to use HTTP when accessing the registry API.

For an image registry service named `foobar`, running in `default` namespace, on port `5000`, the following would be the expected configuration.

```yaml
docker_insecure_registries: ["foobar.default.svc.cluster.local:5000"]
```

##### `image_registry_fqdns`

When using a private registry hosted on the cluster, the image references in the CNF's helm chart may refer to the registry host with the Kubernetes service name alone. The CNF Testsuite runs a docker daemon in a separate `cnf-testsuite` namespace on the Kubernetes cluster. So it is required for the testsuite to be aware of the FQDN of the service, along with the port.

Use this option to configure FQDNs of image registries for the testsuite to access.

If the CNF's helm charts use the image url `foobar:5000/hello:latest`, then please use the configuration in below in `cnf-testsuite.yml` to provide the FQDN mapping for the image registry.

```yaml
image_registry_fqdns:
    "foobar:5000": "foobar.default.svc.cluster.local:5000"
```

##### five_g_parameters

Described below: [link](#5G-parameters)

#### Deployments

Deployments are defined as three arrays, each for different installation method. Each array element represents one deployment, and they are meant to represent a single CNF together.
At least one deployment should exist in CNF config for it to be a proper config.
All info for deployments is used in cnf_install and cnf_uninstall tasks.

```yaml
deployments:
  helm_charts:
  ...
  helm_dirs:
  ...
  manifests:
  ...
```

##### Deployment priority

To ensure deployments are executed in a specific order, you can use the `priority` parameter. Deployments are processed in ascending order of their `priority` values, starting with the lowest. During uninstallation, the order is reversed, processing from the highest `priority` value to the lowest. If the `priority` parameter is not specified, it defaults to 0.

```yaml
deployments:
  helm_dirs: 
    - name: envoy # deploys second
      helm_directory: ../example-cnfs/envoy/envoy
      priority: 1
  manifests: 
    - name: nginx # implicit priority = 0, deploys first
      manifest_directory: manifests
```

##### helm_charts

Deployment, defined by helm chart and helm repository.
Helm repository name and url can be omitted if repository is already present locally. 
Explanations with example:

```yaml
helm_charts:
  - name: coredns  # Name of the deployment
    helm_repo_name: stable  # Name of the repository for the helm chart
    helm_repo_url: https://cncf.gitlab.io/stable  # Repository URL
    helm_chart_name: coredns  # Name of the helm chart in format repo_name/chart_name
    helm_values: --set myvalue=42 # Additional values that would be used for helm installation
    namespace: cnf-default # Namespace to which deployment would be installed (cnf-default is default)
```

##### helm_dirs

Deployment, defined by directory with Chart.yaml file and all templates for resources.
Explanations with example:
```yaml
helm_dirs:
  - name: envoy  # Name of the deployment
    helm_directory: chart  # Path to the directory with Chart.yaml, relative to CNF configuration file
    helm_values: --set myvalue=42 # Additional values that would be used for helm installation
    namespace: cnf-default # Namespace to which deployment would be installed (cnf-default is default)
```

##### manifests

Deployment, defined by directory with manifest files, that are meant to be directly installed by Kubernetes.
Explanations with example:
```yaml
manifests:
  - name: nginx  # Name of the deployment
    manifest_directory: manifests  # Path to the directory with deployment manifests, relative to CNF configuration file
```

### 5G Parameters

These parameters are used for RAN, Open5gs and UERANSIM tests

#### `ric_label`

The ran tests expect a ric to be configured under the ric_label.  The entry must be the k8s label which is most likely a full key/value identification.

For a ric named `flexrric`, under the label key `app.kubernetes.io/name` the following would be the expected configuration.

```yaml
ric_label:  app.kubernetes.io/name=flexric
