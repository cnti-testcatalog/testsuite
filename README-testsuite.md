The CNF Conformance test suite is a tool that makes it possible to validate telco applications, aka Cloud native Network Functions (CNFs), and the underlying Telecom platforms adherence to Cloud native principles and best practices.

This test suite initiative works closely with the [CNF WG](cnf-wg/README.md) which determines requirements for the CNF Conformance program.

The CNF Conformance Test Suite will inspect CNFs for the following characteristics: 
- **Compatibility** - CNFs should work with any Certified Kubernetes product and any CNI-compatible network that meet their functionality requirements.
- **Statelessness** - The CNF's state should be stored in a custom resource definition or a separate database (e.g. etcd) rather than requiring local storage. The CNF should also be resilient to node failure.
- **Security** - CNF containers should be isolated from one another and the host.
- **Microservice** - The CNF should be developed and delivered as a microservice.
- **Scalability** - CNFs should support horizontal scaling (across multiple machines) and vertical scaling (between sizes of machines).
- **Configuration and Lifecycle** - The CNF's configuration and lifecycle should be managed in a declarative manner, using ConfigMaps, Operators, or other declarative interfaces.  
- **Observability** - CNFs should externalize their internal states in a way that supports metrics, tracing, and logging.
- **Installable and Upgradeable** - CNFs should use standard, in-band deployment tools such as Helm (version 3) charts.
- **Hardware Resources and Scheduling** - The CNF container should access all hardware and schedule to specific worker nodes by using a device plugin.
- **Resilience** - CNFs should be resilient to failures inevitable in cloud environments. CNF Resilience should be tested to ensure CNFs are designed to deal with non-carrier-grade shared cloud HW/SW platform.

See the [Conformance Test Categories Documentation](https://github.com/cncf/cnf-conformance/blob/master/TEST-CATEGORIES.md) for a complete overview of the tests.

## Implementation overview

The CNF Conformance Test Suite leverages upstream tools such as [OPA Gatekeeper](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/gatekeeper), [Helm linter](https://github.com/helm/chart-testing), and [Promtool](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/unit_testing_rules/) for testing CNFs. The upstream tool installation, configuration, and versioning has been made repeatable.

The test framework and tests (using the upstream tools) are written in the human readable, compiled language, [Crystal](https://crystal-lang.org/). Common capabilities like dependencies between tests and categories are supported.

Setup of vanilla upstream K8s on [Equinix Metal](https://metal.equinix.com/) is done with the [CNF Testbed](https://github.com/cncf/cnf-testbed/) platform tool chain, which includes [k8s-infra](https://github.com/crosscloudci/k8s-infra), [Kubespray](https://kubespray.io/). To add support for other providers, please submit a [Pull Request](https://github.com/cncf/cnf-testbed/pulls) to the [CNF Testbed](https://github.com/cncf/cnf-testbed/) repo.
