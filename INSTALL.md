Installing the CNF Conformance Test Suite
---

This guide shows how to install the CNF Conformance Test Suite


# Source Install

## Installation
  * Install [crystal-lang](https://crystal-lang.org/install/) version 0.30.1
  * Install the project's crystal dependencies
  ```
  shards install
  ```
  * #### First clone this cnf-conformance repository 
  ```
  cd cnf-conformance
  ```
  * #### Next clone the CNF-Testbed 
  ```
  cd cnfs/ && git clone https://github.com/cncf/cnf-testbed.git
  ```
  * #### (Optional: Create a K8s cluster if you don't already have one)

  * follow the [kind install](KIND-INSTALL.md) instructions to setup a cluster in kind


  * Clone the K8s-infra repo then Follow the [prerequisites](https://github.com/cncf/cnf-testbed/tree/master/tools#pre-requisites) for [deploying a K8s cluster](https://github.com/cncf/cnf-testbed/tree/master/tools#deploying-a-kubernetes-cluster-using-the-makefile--ci-tools)  for a Packet host. 

  *Or* 
  * If you already have IP addresses for your provider, and you want to manually install a K8s cluster, you can use k8s-infra to do this.
  ```
  cd tools/ && git clone https://github.com/crosscloudci/k8s-infra.git
  ```
  * #### Follow the [K8s-infra quick start](https://github.com/crosscloudci/k8s-infra/blob/master/README.md#quick-start) for instructions on how to install

  * Make sure you set your KUBECONFIG
  ```
  export KUBECONFIG=<yourkubeconfig>
  ```
  * Modify the cnf-conformance.yml file settings for your cnfs in your cnf's base directory 
  ```
  # In ./cnfs/YOURCNFDIRECTORY/cnf-conformance.yml
  
helm_directory: 
install_script: 
deployment_name: 
helm_chart: 
helm_chart_container_name: 
white_list_helm_chart_container_names: 
  ```

  * Run the setup tasks to install any prerequisites (useful for setting up sample cnfs)
  ``` 
  crystal src/cnf-conformance.cr setup
  ```
  * Run the cleanup tasks to remove prerequisites (useful for starting fresh)
  ``` 
  crystal src/cnf-conformance.cr cleanup
  ```
  * Install your CNF into the cnfs directory, download the helm charts, and download the source code:
  ```
  crystal src/cnf-conformance.cr cnf_setup cnf-path=<your cnf directory>
  ```
  * To remove your CNF from the cnfs directory and cluster
  ```
  crystal src/cnf-conformance.cr cnf_cleanup cnf-path=<your cnf directory>
  ```
  * (Optional) To set up a *sample cnf* for use with cnf-conformance
  ``` 
  crystal src/cnf-conformance.cr sample_coredns_setup
  ```
### (optional) Build binary

```
crystal build src/cnf-conformance.cr --release
```

then you can invoke the conformance suite from the binary i.e.

```
./cnf-conformance setup
```



### Get ready to rock and roll! 

## Example Usage (or see the [complete usage documentation](https://github.com/cncf/cnf-conformance/blob/master/USAGE.md))
  ```
  # Run all ga tests (generally available tests)
  crystal src/cnf-conformance.cr all 
  
  # Run all beta and ga tests
  crystal src/cnf-conformance.cr all beta
  
  # Run all alpha, beta, and ga tests
  crystal src/cnf-conformance.cr all alpha
  
  # Run all wip, alpha, beta, and ga tests
  crystal src/cnf-conformance.cr all wip
  
  # Run all tests in the configureation lifecycle category
  crystal src/cnf-conformance.cr configuration_lifecycle 
  
  # Run all tests in the installability
  crystal src/cnf-conformance.cr installability 
  ```

## Development
  The CNF Conformance Test Suite is modeled after make, or if you're familiar with Ruby, [rake](https://github.com/ruby/rake). Conformance tests are created via tasks using the Crystal library, [SAM.cr](https://github.com/imdrasil/sam.cr). 

  To run the automated test suite:
  ``` 
  crystal spec
  ```

**Binary build**

```
crystal build src/cnf-conformance.cr --release
sha256sum cnf-conformance
```

# CNF Developer Install and Usage guide

## Prerequisites

- [Kubectl binary is installed](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/)
- [Access](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-application-cluster/access-cluster/) to a working [Certified K8s](https://cncf.io/ck) cluster via [KUBECONFIG environment variable](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-application-cluster/configure-access-multiple-clusters/#set-the-kubeconfig-environment-variable). (See [K8s Getting started guide](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/) for options)
    - `export KUBECONFIG=$HOME/mycluster.config`
    - Running `kubectl cluster-info` should show a running Kubernetes master in the output
- CNF must have a helm chart
  - To pass all current tests
  - To support auto deployment of CNF from configuration ([docs](https://github.com/cncf/cnf-conformance/blob/master/CNF_CONFORMANCE_YML_USAGE.md))


## Setup and configuration

### Download/Install the conformance suite

- Download the latest [binary release](https://github.com/cncf/cnf-conformance/releases)
- Make the binary executable (eg. `chmod +x cnf-conformance`)
- Move the downloaded binary to somewhere in your executable PATH (eg. `sudo cp cnf-conformance /usr/local/bin/cnf-conformance`)

 **Alternatives**

- [source install](https://github.com/cncf/cnf-conformance/blob/master/INSTALL.md#source-install) above


### Configure the conformance suite for testing a CNF
- Initialize the test suite by running `cnf-conformance setup` (creates cnfs folder and other items)
- Create a Conformance configuration file called `cnf-confromance.yml` under the your CNF folder (eg. `cnfs/my_ipsec_cnf/cnf-conformance.yml`)
  - See example config (See [latest example in repo](https://github.com/cncf/cnf-conformance/blob/master/cnf-conformance.example.yml)): 
    - Optionally, copy the example configuration file, [`cnf-conformance-example.yml`](https://github.com/cncf/cnf-conformance/blob/master/cnf-conformance.example.yml), and modify appropriately
- Setup your CNF for testing and deploy it to the cluster by running `cnf-conformance cnf_setup cnf-path=path_to_your/cnf_folder`
    - _NOTE: if you do not want to automatically deploy the using the helm chart defined in the configuration then you MUST pass `deploy_with_chart=false` to the `cnf_setup` command._


## Running and checking results for the Conformance testing


**Running all tests**

```
cnf-conformance all
```

**Checking the results**

In the console where the test suite runs:
- PASSED or FAILED will be displayed for the tests

A test log file, eg. `cnf-conformance-results-20200401.txt`, will be created which lists PASS or FAIL for every test

**Cleaning up**

Run `cnf-conformance cnf_cleanup cnf-path=path_to_your/cnf_folder` 

_NOTE: Does not handle manually deployed CNFs_
