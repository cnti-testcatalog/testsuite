# Compatibility, Installability, and Upgradability Category


<!-- TODO: look into using the combined alias and a single score

## [Increase decrease capacity](https://github.com/cnti-testcatalog/testsuite/blob/main/src/tasks/workload/compatibility.cr#L168)
- :memo: Candidate for CNF Certification
- :heavy_check_mark: Added to CNF Test Suite in release vXXX
- Expectation: pod should be capable of scaling up and down as needed



<b>increase_decrease_capacity test:</b> HPA (horizonal pod autoscale) will autoscale replicas to accommodate when there is an increase of CPU, memory or other configured metrics to prevent disruption by allowing more requests 
by balancing out the utilisation across all of the pods.

Decreasing replicas works the same as increase but rather scale down the number of replicas when the traffic decreases to the number of pods that can handle the requests.

You can read more about horizonal pod autoscaling to create replicas [here](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/horizontal-pod-autoscale/) and in the [K8s scaling cheatsheet](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/cheatsheet/#scaling-resources).

**What's tested:** This verifies that there is only one process type within one container. This does not count against child processes. Example would be nginx or httpd could have a parent process and then 10 child processes but if both nginx and httpd were running, this test would fail.

[**Usage**](../USAGE.md#single-process-type-in-one-container)

[**Rationale & Reasoning**](../RATIONALE.md#to-check-if-the-cnf-has-multiple-process-types-within-one-container-single_process_type)

[**Rationale & Reasoning**](../RATIONALE.md#to-test-if-the-cnf-uses-a-volume-host-path-volume_hostpath_not_found)


## [No local volume configuration](https://github.com/cnti-testcatalog/testsuite/blob/v0.27.0/src/tasks/workload/state.cr#L457)

# Reliability, Resilience and Availability Category

## [CNF under network latency](https://github.com/cnti-testcatalog/testsuite/blob/v0.27.0/src/tasks/workload/reliability.cr#L231)
- Expectation: The CNF should continue to function when network latency occurs

**What's tested:** [This experiment](https://litmuschaos.github.io/litmus/experiments/categories/pods/pod-network-latency/) causes network degradation without the pod being marked unhealthy/unworthy of traffic by kube-proxy (unless you have a liveness probe of sorts that measures latency and restarts/crashes the container). The idea of this experiment is to simulate issues within your pod network OR microservice communication across services in different availability zones/regions etc.

The applications may stall or get corrupted while they wait endlessly for a packet. The experiment limits the impact (blast radius) to only the traffic you want to test by specifying IP addresses or application information. This experiment will help to improve the resilience of your services over time.

[**Usage**](../USAGE.md#cnf-network-latency)

[**Rationale & Reasoning**](../RATIONALE.md#test-if-the-cnf-crashes-when-network-latency-occurs-pod_network_latency)



## [CNF with host disk fill](https://github.com/cnti-testcatalog/testsuite/blob/v0.27.0/src/tasks/workload/reliability.cr#L390)
- Expectation: The CNF should continue to function when disk fill occurs and pods should not be evicted to another node.

**What's tested:** [This experiment](https://litmuschaos.github.io/litmus/experiments/categories/pods/disk-fill/) stresses the disk with continuous and heavy IO to cause degradation in the shared disk. This experiment also reduces the amount of scratch space available on a node which can lead to a lack of space for newer containers to get scheduled. This can cause (Kubernetes gives up by applying an "eviction" taint like "disk-pressure") a wholesale movement of all pods to other nodes. 

[**Usage**](../USAGE.md#cnf-disk-fill)

[**Rationale & Reasoning**](../RATIONALE.md#test-if-the-cnf-crashes-when-disk-fill-occurs-disk_fill)


##  [Pod delete](https://github.com/cnti-testcatalog/testsuite/blob/v0.27.0/src/tasks/workload/reliability.cr#L441)
- Expectation: The CNF should continue to function when pod delete occurs

**What's tested:** [This experiment](https://litmuschaos.github.io/litmus/experiments/categories/pods/pod-delete/) helps to simulate such a scenario with forced/graceful pod failure on specific or random replicas of an application resource and checks the deployment sanity (replica availability & uninterrupted service) and recovery workflow of the application.

[**Usage**](../USAGE.md#pod-delete)

[**Rationale & Reasoning**](../RATIONALE.md#test-if-the-cnf-crashes-when-pod-delete-occurs-pod_delete)


## [Memory hog](https://github.com/cnti-testcatalog/testsuite/blob/v0.27.0/src/tasks/workload/reliability.cr#L495)
- Expectation: The CNF should continue to function when pod memory hog occurs

**What's tested:** The [pod-memory hog](https://litmuschaos.github.io/litmus/experiments/categories/pods/pod-memory-hog/) experiment launches a stress process within the target container - which can cause either the primary process in the container to be resource constrained in cases where the limits are enforced OR eat up available system memory on the node in cases where the limits are not specified.  

[**Usage**](../USAGE.md#memory-hog)

[**Rationale & Reasoning**](../RATIONALE.md#test-if-the-cnf-crashes-when-pod-memory-hog-occurs-pod_memory_hog)



## [IO Stress](https://github.com/cnti-testcatalog/testsuite/blob/v0.27.0/src/tasks/workload/reliability.cr#L549)

**What's tested:** The [pod-io stress](https://litmuschaos.github.io/litmus/experiments/categories/pods/pod-io-stress/) experiment the disk with continuous and heavy IO to cause degradation in reads/writes by other microservices that use this shared disk.

[**Usage**](../USAGE.md#io-stress)

[**Rationale & Reasoning**](../RATIONALE.md#test-if-the-cnf-crashes-when-pod-io-stress-occurs-pod_io_stress)



## [Network corruption](https://github.com/cnti-testcatalog/testsuite/blob/v0.27.0/src/tasks/workload/reliability.cr#L284)

**What's tested:** The [pod-network corruption](https://litmuschaos.github.io/litmus/experiments/categories/pods/pod-network-corruption/) experiment injects packet corruption on the CNF by starting a traffic control (tc) process with netem rules to add egress packet corruption.

[**Usage**](../USAGE.md#network-corruption)

[**Rationale & Reasoning**](../RATIONALE.md#test-if-the-cnf-crashes-when-pod-network-corruption-occurs-pod_network_corruption)


## [Network duplication](https://github.com/cnti-testcatalog/testsuite/blob/v0.27.0/src/tasks/workload/reliability.cr#L337)
- Expectation: The CNF should continue to function and be resilient to a duplicate network.

**What's tested:** The [pod-network duplication](https://litmuschaos.github.io/litmus/experiments/categories/pods/pod-network-duplication/) experiment injects network duplication into the CNF by starting a traffic control (tc) process with netem rules to add egress delays. 

[**Usage**](../USAGE.md#network-duplication)

[**Rationale & Reasoning**](../RATIONALE.md#test-if-the-cnf-crashes-when-pod-network-duplication-occurs-pod_network_duplication)

## [Pod DNS errors](https://github.com/cnti-testcatalog/testsuite/blob/v0.26.0/src/tasks/workload/reliability.cr#L604)
- :heavy_check_mark: Added to CNF Test Suite in release v0.26.0
- Expectation: That the CNF dosen't crash is resilient to DNS resolution failures.

**What's tested:** The [pod-dns error](https://litmuschaos.github.io/litmus/experiments/categories/pods/pod-dns-error/) experiment injects chaos to disrupt DNS resolution in kubernetes pods and causes loss of access to services by blocking DNS resolution of hostnames/domains.

[**Usage**](../USAGE.md#pod-dns-errors)

[**Rationale & Reasoning**](../RATIONALE.md#test-if-the-cnf-crashes-when-dns-errors-occur-pod_dns_errors)
