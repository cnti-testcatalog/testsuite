# What is [CoreDNS](https://coredns.io/)

CoreDNS is a DNS server/forwarder, written in Go, that chains plugins. Each plugin performs a (DNS) function.

DNS is a critical network function that can be found in many Telecom use cases such as the vCPE.

CoreDNS can listen for DNS requests coming in over UDP/TCP, TLS (RFC 7858), also called DoT, DNS over HTTP/2 - DoH - (RFC 8484) and gRPC (not a standard).
