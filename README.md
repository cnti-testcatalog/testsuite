The CNTi Test Catalog is an open source and vendor neutral tool that can be used to validate a telco application's adherence to [cloud native principles](https://networking.cloud-native-principles.org/) and best practices. 

This Test Catalog focus area is one part of LF Networking's [Cloud Native Telecom Initiative (CNTi)](https://wiki.lfnetworking.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=113213592) and works closely with the [CNTi Best Practices](https://wiki.lfnetworking.org/display/LN/Best+Practices) and [CNTi Certification](https://wiki.lfnetworking.org/display/LN/Certification) focus areas.

## Installation and Usage

To get the CNTi Test Catalog up and running, see the [Installation Guide](INSTALL.md).

#### To give it a try immediately you can use these quick install steps

Prereqs: Kubernetes cluster, wget, curl, helm 3.1.1 or greater on your system already.

1. Install the latest test suite binary: `source <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cnti-testcatalog/testsuite/main/curl_install.sh)`
2. Run `setup` to prepare the cnf-testsuite: `cnf-testsuite setup`
3. Pull down an example CNF configuration to try: `curl -o cnf-testsuite.yml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cnti-testcatalog/testsuite/main/example-cnfs/coredns/cnf-testsuite.yml`
4. Initialize the test suite for using the CNF: `cnf-testsuite cnf_setup cnf-config=./cnf-testsuite.yml`
5. Run all of application/workload tests: `cnf-testsuite workload`

#### More Usage docs

Check out the [usage documentation](USAGE.md) for more info about invoking commands and logging.

## Cloud Native Test Categories

The CNTi Test Catalog will inspect CNFs for the following characteristics:

- **Configuration** - The CNF's configuration should be managed in a declarative manner, using ConfigMaps, Operators, or other declarative interfaces.
- **Compatibility, Installability & Upgradability** - CNFs should work with any Certified Kubernetes product and any CNI-compatible network that meet their functionality requirements while using standard, in-band deployment tools such as Helm (version 3) charts.
- **Microservice** - The CNF should be developed and delivered as a microservice.
- **State** - The CNF's state should be stored in a custom resource definition or a separate database (e.g. etcd) rather than requiring local storage. The CNF should also be resilient to node failure.
- **Reliability, Resilience & Availability** - CNFs should be reliable, resilient and available to failures inevitable in cloud environments. CNFs should be tested to ensure they are designed to deal with non-carrier-grade shared cloud HW/SW platforms.
- **Observability & Diagnostics** - CNFs should externalize their internal states in a way that supports metrics, tracing, and logging.
- **Security** - CNF containers should be isolated from one another and the host. CNFs are to be verified against any common CVE or other vulnerabilities.

See the [Test Documentation](docs/TEST_DOCUMENTATION.md) for a complete overview of the tests.
