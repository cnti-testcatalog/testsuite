### Overview
The CNF Conformance Test suite can be run in production mode (using an executable) or in developer mode (using [crystal lang directly](https://github.com/cncf/cnf-conformance/blob/master/INSTALL.md#source-install)).  See the [pseudo code documentation](https://github.com/cncf/cnf-conformance/blob/master/PSEUDO-CODE.md) for examples of how the internals of WIP tests might work.

### Syntax for running any of the tests
```
# Production mode
./cnf-conformance <testname>

# Developer mode
crystal src/cnf-conformance.cr <testname>
```
:star: *Note: All usage commands in this document will use the production (binary executable) syntax unless otherwise stated.

* :heavy_check_mark: indicates implemented into stable release
* :bulb: indicates Proof of Concept
* :memo: indicates To Do
* :x: indicates WARNINGS*

### Common Example Commands

#### Building the executable
This is the command to build the binary executable if in developer mode or using the source install method ([requires crystal](https://github.com/cncf/cnf-conformance/blob/master/INSTALL.md#source-install)):
```
crystal build src/cnf-conformance.cr
```

#### Validating a cnf-conformance.yml file:
```
./cnf-conformance validate_config cnf-config=[PATH_TO]/cnf-conformance.yml
```

#### Running all of the CNF Conformance tests (platform and workload):
``` 
./cnf-conformance all cnf-config=<path_to_your_config_file>/cnf-conformance.yml
```

#### Running all of the CNF Conformance tests (including proofs of concepts)
``` 
./cnf-conformance all poc cnf-config=<path_to_your_config_file>/cnf-conformance.yml
```
#### Running all of the workload CNF Conformance tests
``` 
crystal src/cnf-conformance.cr workload
cnf-config=<path_to_your_config_file>/cnf-conformance.yml
```

#### Running all of the platform or workload CNF Conformance tests independently:

##### Run platform only tests:
``` 
./cnf-conformance platform
```
##### Run workload only tests:
```
./cnf-conformance workload 
```

#### Get available options and to see all available tests from command line:
```
./cnf-conformance help
```

#### Clean up the CNF Conformance test suite, the K8s cluster, and upstream projects:
```
./cnf-conformance cleanup
```
---
### Logging Options

#### Update the loglevel from command line:
```
# cmd line
./cnf-conformance -l debug test
```
#### If in developer mode, make sure to use - - if running from source:
```
crystal src/cnf-conformance.cr -- -l debug test 
```

#### You can also use env var for logging:
```
LOGLEVEL=DEBUG ./cnf-conformance test
```

:star: Note: When setting log level, the following is the order of precedence:

1. CLI or Command line flag
2. Environment variable
3. CNF-Conformance [Config file](https://github.com/cncf/cnf-conformance/blob/master/config.yml)

##### Verbose Option
Also setting the verbose option for many tasks will add extra output to help with debugging

```
./cnf-conformance test_name verbose
```

#### Running The Linter in Developer Mode

See https://github.com/crystal-ameba/ameba for more details. Follow the [INSTALL](https://github.com/cncf/cnf-conformance/blob/master/INSTALL.md) guide starting at the [Source Install](https://github.com/cncf/cnf-conformance/blob/master/INSTALL.md#source-install) for more details running cnf-conformance in developer mode.

```
shards install # only for first install
crystal bin/ameba.cr
